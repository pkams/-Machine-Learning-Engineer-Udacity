# Capstone Project 

This repository contains the proposal, reports and files for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Capstone Project.

The data for this project can be acessed in the Kaggle page [Fire Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/phylake1337/fire-dataset)

Field: Computer Vision

Objective: Early detection systems using computer vision with AI could help firefighters combat blazes, aid in recovery, and prevent wildfires from starting to begin with. In addition, it is possible that environmental and political advocates create control and prevention systems with the mapped data obtained.

Project details:

- To download the data from kaggle you need to download the kaggle.json token, documentation: https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api
- Every .py script is a model architecture with different specifications.

To reproduce this project upload all the files (with addition of your kaggle.json token to have the permission to acess and download the data) to a Sagemaker notebook instance using *_conda_tensorflow_py36_* environemnt. The steps inside of the .ipynb can be reproduced running line by line, includying the additional libraries like split-folders.
