# Capstone Project Proposal

This repository contains a proposal for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Capstone Project.

The data for this project can be acessed in the Kaggle page [Fire Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/phylake1337/fire-dataset)

Field: Computer Vision

Objective: Early detection systems using computer vision with AI could help firefighters combat blazes, aid in recovery, and prevent wildfires from starting to begin with. In addition, it is possible that environmental and political advocates create control and prevention systems with the mapped data obtained.
